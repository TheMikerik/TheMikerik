# Hi there, I'm Michal Ručka! 👋

## 🔧 My Current Projects
- **Spaced Cards** – A space-themed mobile flashcard app that integrates with Screen Time to help you focus. It blocks access to selected apps until you go through a set number of flashcards.
- **Scanit** - An on-demand 3D Scanner app for **[IngCorporation](http://www.ingcorporation.cz)** as my final project for my bachelor's thesis.
- **ActiveAppOverlayer** - A Flutter package that allows you to overlay an app over the entire screen when the selected app is opened.
